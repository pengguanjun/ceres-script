============

About
-----
ceres-script is a python script to build ceres solver, simple and easy to use, especially on Windows platform.

Building ceres solver on Windows platform is a very troublesome task, because it relies on third-party libraries
such as glog, gflag, eigen, lapack, blas, suitespare and so on. It may take several hours to download and configure
these third-party libraries. The foundation of this project comes from the build script of colmap, which greatly
reduces the difficulty of building on Windows platform. On the basis of the colmap build script, this project
adds support for local glog, gflag, eigen, suitespare and other third-party libraries. In other words, users can
specify a local third-party library instead of a fixed version downloaded from the Internet. This will help the
third-party library that ceres solver relies on to be consistent with the third-party library used locally by user.

How to use
----------
1. Install cmake, python 3.5+.
2. Install Requests via pip($ python -m pip install requests).
3. Run the following script from shell or cmd.
```
python D:\ThirdLibs\ceres-solver\build.py --build_path D:\ThirdLibs\ceres-solver\ceres-solver-build 
--ceres_path D:\ThirdLibs\ceres-solver\ceres-solver --with_suite_sparse --no_ssl_verification 
--cmake_generator "Visual Studio 15 2017" --no_ssl_verification 
```
